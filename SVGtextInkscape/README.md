# SVGinktxt - Mini parser for Texts and Automatization of CLI Debbuging

## What's the parser is supposed to be used for

This program includes a basic parser for SVG texts generated by Inkscape. It removes the transformation matrix
that is applied to each text line by simply applying the matrix's transformation to the coordinates of the
first item on that line. For simplicity, and because the y-coordinate of the first item is always negative in
these instances, I only look for the negative value. Inkscape uses a full matrix just to convert a negative
y-coordinate to a positive one, so my task is to extract the y-translation from the matrix, eliminate the
matrix, and then add this value to the negative y-coordinate of the first element in the line.

By doing this, the matrix effectively becomes an identity matrix, a fact that allows us to remove it.
Inkscape usually creates one text item per line, where this item has only one y-coordinate and a series
of x-coordinates, one for each character in the text. This setup is commonly used for text justification.

In some versions of Illustrator, text justification can be problematic. When converting files to SVG, a
line that appeared perfectly justified on-screen might occasionally split the last word, leaving a hyphen
at the end of one line and the remainder of the word on the next. This disrupts the intended formatting
where words were carefully chosen to fit neatly within the paragraph. What was once beautiful and harmonious
can end up looking awkward and unappealing.

A simple solution to this issue is to convert the entire file in Illustrator to PDF, then import that
PDF into Inkscape and save it as an SVG. However, Inkscape tends to be overly verbose and uses internal
variables containing the word "inkscape" throughout. The ideal approach here would be to locate the
problematic line in the Inkscape-generated file, copy it along with all lines affected by the problem,
and replace the corresponding lines in the Illustrator-generated file. However, it's often much simpler
to delete the entire paragraph or set of paragraphs from the Illustrator file and replace them with the
text from the Inkscape file.

Newer versions of Inkscape have streamlined this process significantly. The only peculiar aspect is the
application of one matrix per line solely for a single y-coordinate translation. SVGinktxt is used to
automatically strip these matrices from the text items copied from the Inkscape-generated file. The 
resulting output can then be manually pasted into the appropriate place in the Illustrator-generated file.
